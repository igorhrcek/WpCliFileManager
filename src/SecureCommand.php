/**
* Adds or removes security rules to .htaccess or nginx.conf to strengthen security of the WordPress installation
*
* Secure is capable of providing configurations for both Apache and nginx. Apache is a default, but you can manually
* specify server type.
*
* By default, all rules are written in the .htaccess file or nginx.conf file if nginx is set as a server type.
* You can also set a custom path to a file that should be used for writing security rules into.
*
* ## EXAMPLES
*
*     # Add security rule
*     $ wp secure disable-directory-browsing
*     Success: Directory Browsing is disabled.
*
*     # Remove security rule
*     $ wp secure disable-directory-browsing --disable
*     Success: Directory Browsing is enabled.
*
*     # Remove all security rules
*     $ wp secure flush
*
*     # Add security rule to a custom file
*     $ wp secure disable-directory-browsing --file-path=/some/file/path/.htaccess
*
*     # Display the output only (no writing)
*     $ wp secure disable-directory-browsing --output
*
*     # Specify web server type
*     $ wp secure disable-directory-browsing --server=nginx
