/**
 * Adds or removes security rules to .htaccess or nginx.conf to strengthen security of the WordPress installation
 *
 * Secure is capable of providing configurations for both Apache and nginx. Apache is a default, but you can manually
 * specify server type.
 *
 * By default, all rules are written in the .htaccess file or nginx.conf file if nginx is set as a server type.
 * You can also set a custom path to a file that should be used for writing security rules into.
 *
 * ## EXAMPLES
 *
 *     # Add security rule
 *     $ wp secure disable-directory-browsing
 *     Success: Directory Browsing is disabled.
 *
 *     # Remove security rule
 *     $ wp secure disable-directory-browsing --remove
 *     Success: Directory Browsing is enabled.
 *
 *     # Remove all security rules
 *     $ wp secure flush
 *
 *     # Add security rule to a custom file
 *     $ wp secure disable-directory-browsing --file-path=/some/file/path/.htaccess
 *
 *     # Display the output only (no writing)
 *     $ wp secure disable-directory-browsing --output
 *
 *     # Specify web server type
 *     $ wp secure disable-directory-browsing --server=nginx
